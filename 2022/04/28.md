To avoid compressing and uncompressing pages too many times, InnoDB tries to keep both compressed and uncompressed pages in the buffer pool when there is enough room. This results in a bigger cache. When there is not enough room, an adaptive LRU algorithm is used to decide whether compressed or uncompressed pages should be evicted from the buffer: for CPU-bound workloads, the compressed pages are evicted first; for I/O-bound workloads, the uncompressed pages are evicted first. Of course, when necessary, both the compressed and uncompressed version of the same data can be evicted from the buffer.
